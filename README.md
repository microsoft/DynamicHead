This is the official implementation of CVPR 2021 paper "Dynamic Head: Unifying Object Detection Heads with Attentions". 

_"In this paper, we present a novel dynamic head framework to unify object detection heads with attentions. 
By coherently combining multiple self-attention mechanisms between feature levels for scale-awareness, among spatial locations for spatial-awareness, and within output channels for task-awareness, the proposed approach significantly improves the representation ability of object detection heads without any computational overhead."_

### Model Zoo

~~Code and Model are under internal review and will release soon. Stay tuned!~~

In order to open-source, we have ported the implementation from our internal framework to Detectron2 and re-train the models.

We notice better performances on some models compared to original paper.

# My Notes

Hi there, I am a recent undergrad graduate and am currently looking for ML positions. I always wanted to learn how to implement code from a paper, and I was happy to implement the DyHead attachment that can be used by others. 

All the code I wrote uses PyTorch, these are all the modules:
1. [`concat_fpn_output.py`](./torch/concat_fpn_output.py) - This takes the output of the FPN and concatenates all the levels to the median height and width of all the levels via upsampling or downsampling.
2. [`attention_layers.py`](./torch/attention_layers.py) - This contains all the classes for the three attention mechanisms.
 - Big Thanks to user Github [Islanna](https://github.com/Islanna/), she implemented code from the [Dynamic ReLU Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10027.pdf). The Task-aware Attention layer uses the same technique from Dynamic-ReLU-A that constructs a dynamic ReLU funtion that are both spatial and channel shared. I used her code as a way to understand how to implement it and I used the same techniques but made the code simpler for my own learning process, but all credits to her. This is her repository: https://github.com/Islanna/DynamicReLU.

4. [`DyHead.py`](./torch/DyHead.py) - This contains the classes to construct a single DyHead block or the entire DyHead.

The [`DyHead_Example.ipynb`](./torch/DyHead_Example.ipynb) notebook demonstrates how all the classes above work, I would encourage to have a look.

The code used is not the most efficient, but the code is well documented and easily understandable. However, I am sure changes to make it more efficient is not a problem.

## Future Additions:
The code does not contruct a full Object Detection model with a DyHead. This is the case because I currently need to change my focus on to just find a new position but also I was confused about the implementation of ROI Pooling on the tensor *F* since dimensions do not contain the spacial dimensions since it was reshaped to be LxSxC not LxHxWxC. I would like to hear more about how this is implemented.

So in the future when I have more time and a better understanding, I would like to implement both one-stage and two-stage detectors using PyTorch's Built-in FasterRCNN modules to easily adapt the inclusion of DyHead for detection purposes.
